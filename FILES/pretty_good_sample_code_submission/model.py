'''
Sample predictive model.
You must supply at least 4 methods:
- fit: trains the model.
- predict: uses the model to perform predictions.
- save: saves the model.
- load: reloads the model.

        Both inputs are numpy arrays.
        For classification, labels could be either numbers 0, 1, ... c-1 for c classe
        or one-hot encoded vector of zeros, with a 1 at the kth position for class k.
        The AutoML format support on-hot encoding, which also works for multi-labels problems.
        Use data_converter.convert_to_num() to convert to the category number format.
        For regression, labels are continuous values.

        This function should provide predictions of labels on (test) data.
        Here we just return zeros...
        Make sure that the predicted values are in the correct format for the scoring
        metric. For example, binary classification problems often expect predictions
        in the form of a discriminant value (if the area under the ROC curve it the metric)
        rather that predictions of the class labels themselves. For multi-class or multi-labels
        problems, class probabilities are often expected if the metric is cross-entropy.
        Scikit-learn also has a function predict-proba, we do not require it.
        The function predict eventually can return probabilities.

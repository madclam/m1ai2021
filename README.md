Material for the M1 AI class at University Paris-Saclay

Clone this repo and make changes as desired. Keep the structure of the starting kit. The directory FILES contains additional useful files that will be needed when uploading the challenge to Codalab.

Usage:

	`cd starting_kit/utilities`
	
	`python make_bundle.py`

There are 2 ways of running the script: 
+ with sample data found in the starting kit or 
+ with the real "big" dataset. In this case run:

	`python make_bundle.py starting_kit_dir big_data_dir`
